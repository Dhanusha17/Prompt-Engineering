## AIM:
To create a bedtime story for children aged 5 to 7 about a bat who is afraid of the dark using prompt engineering techniques.

## ALOGORITHM:
# STEP-1: Define the target audience and age group (5–7 years old).
# STEP-2: Choose the main character and the core theme (bat afraid of the dark).
# STEP-3: Specify the tone, style, and purpose of the story (gentle, magical, encouraging).
# STEP-4: Create a detailed prompt including character names, plot, and moral lesson.
# STEP-5: Use the prompt in a generative AI model to produce the story text.

## PROGRAM:
Write a heartwarming bedtime story for children aged 5–7 about a little bat named Benny who is afraid of the dark.  
The story should be simple and engaging, with 10 short parts, each suitable for one illustrated page.  
Use gentle, comforting language with a touch of magic.
