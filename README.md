Title: Benny the Brave Bat

Once upon a time, in a quiet forest, there lived a little bat named Benny.
Benny was unlike other bats — he was afraid of the dark!
When the sun went down, Benny would hide under his blanket, peeking out at the moon with worried eyes.

One evening, Benny’s best friend, Luna the firefly, flew into his room.
“Benny,” she said, “The night isn’t scary! It’s full of magic. Come, I’ll show you.”

Holding onto Luna’s glowing light, Benny fluttered outside.
They saw stars twinkling like diamonds, owls singing gentle songs, and flowers that only bloomed under moonlight.
Benny realized that the dark wasn’t empty — it was full of beautiful things waiting to be seen.

From that day on, Benny spread his wings happily every night, exploring the wonders of the dark with Luna by his side.

And every bedtime, he would whisper, “The night is my friend.”
